(Reuters) - Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp COST.O reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by higher membership fees and strong sales in the United States.

Membership fees, which accounted for about 72 percent of Costcoâ€™s operating income in 2016, rose 4 percent in the third quarter ended May 7.

Sales at established stores open at least a year rose 5 percent, excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange.

Analysts on average were expecting same-store sales to rise 3.7 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.

Net income attributable to Costco rose to $700 million, or $1.59 per share, in the latest quarter from $545 million, or $1.24 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, Costco earned $1.40 per share. The company recorded a tax benefit of 19 cents per share related to a special cash dividend announced in April.

Total sales rose 8 percent to $28.86 billion.

Analysts on average had estimated adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share and revenue of $28.54 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Costco shares were up 1.7 percent at $177.50 in aftermarket trading on Thursday.
